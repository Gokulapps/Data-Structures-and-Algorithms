# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

# Overview 
Welcome to the Data Structures Implementation repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various fundamental data structures, each encapsulated in its own separate file. Whether you're a student learning data structures, a developer looking for reference implementations, or a programming enthusiast keen on expanding your knowledge, this repository serves as a comprehensive resource. <br/>

# Data Structures Classification 
This repository categorizes data structures into Linear and Non-Linear types. Each data structure is implemented in its own Python file, providing clear and concise code examples that demonstrate their core functionalities and operations. <br/>

# Linear Data Structures
Linear Data Structures arrange data elements sequentially, where each element is connected to its previous and next element. <br/>

Stack <br/>
File: Stack.py <br/>
Description: Implements a stack data structure following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. <br/>
<br/>
Queue <br/>
File: Queue.py <br/>
Description: Implements a queue data structure following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. <br/>
<br/>
Circular Queue <br/>
File: CircularQueue.py <br/>
Description: Implements a circular queue to efficiently utilize space by reusing emptied slots. <br/>
<br/>
Linked List <br/>
File: LinkedList.py <br/>
Description: Implements a singly linked list where each node points to the next node in the sequence. <br/> 
<br/> 
Doubly Linked List <br/>
File: DoublyLinkedList.py <br/>
Description: Implements a doubly linked list allowing traversal in both directions. <br/>
<br/>
Hash Map <br/>
File: HashMap.py <br/>
Description: Implements a hash map (dictionary) with collision handling techniques. <br/>
<br/>
Heap <br/>
File: Heap.py <br/>
Description: Implements a heap data structure (both min-heap and max-heap), useful for priority queues and efficient retrieval of minimum/maximum elements. <br/>
<br/>
# Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-Linear Data Structures organize data in a hierarchical manner, allowing multiple relationships between elements. <br/>
<br/>
Graph <br/>
File: Graph.py <br/>
Description: Implements a graph data structure with methods for adding vertices, edges, and performing various graph algorithms. <br/>
<br/>
Binary Search Tree <br/>
File: BinarySearchTree.py <br/>
Description: Implements a binary search tree where each node has up to two children, with the left child less than the parent and the right child greater. <br/>
<br/>
Balanced Tree <br/>
File: BALANCED_TREE.py <br/>
Description: Implements a balanced tree (e.g., AVL or Red-Black Tree) ensuring operations remain efficient. <br/>
<br/>
B⁺-Tree <br/>
File: BPLUS_TREE.py <br/> 
Description: Implements a B⁺-Tree, optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. <br/>

# Getting Started
 
# Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

# Installation
1. Clone the Repository <br/>

Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine: <br/>
[https://github.com/Gokulapps/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git](url)
 
3. Navigate to the Directory <br/>

cd DataStructuresImplementation  <br/>
 
3. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment <br/>

Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies (if any): <br/>
python3 -m venv venv  <br/>
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  <br/>
 
4. Install Dependencies <br/>
There are no external dependencies required as the implementations use Python's standard libraries. <br/>

# Usage
Each Python file contains classes and methods that implement the respective data structures. You can import these classes into your scripts or interact with them directly. <br/>

Example: Using the Stack <br/>

from Stack import Stack  <br/> 
  
## Initialize a stack  
stack = Stack()  <br/>
  
## Push elements  
stack.push(10)  <br/>
stack.push(20)  <br/>
stack.push(30)  <br/>
  
## Display stack  
print(stack)  <br/>
  
## Pop elements  
print("Popped element:", stack.pop())  <br/>
  
## Peek at top element  
print("Top element:", stack.peek())  <br/>
  
## Check if stack is empty  
print("Is stack empty?", stack.is_empty()) <br/>  
 
Expected Output: <br/>

Pushed: 10  <br/>
Stack: 10  <br/>
Pushed: 20  <br/>
Stack: 10 <- 20  <br/>
Pushed: 30  <br/>
Stack: 10 <- 20 <- 30  <br/>
Popped element: 30  <br/>
Top element: 20  <br/>
Is stack empty? False <br/> 
 
Note: Replace the print statements with appropriate outputs based on your implementation. <br/>
